To deploy a new modified project, just replace the .war file under /opt/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy with a new .war file generated by glassfish. Then the project will be deployed automatically. Right now the .war file in use is 'app.war', so the address to visit this project is 'rewind.cs.brown.edu/app'.

The page with address 'rewind.cs.brown.edu' only has a link to rewind homepage now, you can modify it to be fancier later by replacing it(index.html) with other file under /opt/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/docroot.

If you change the address of this project, you need to modify the address of websocket in function 'function connectChatServer()'. This function can be found in web/rewind/js/rewind.js.
